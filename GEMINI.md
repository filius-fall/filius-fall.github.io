# Gemini CLI Changes Log

This document summarizes the changes made by the Gemini CLI agent to convert the Jekyll blog to a Next.js blog.

## Branch Creation
- Created a new branch `nextjs-conversion` for the conversion process.

## Jekyll Removal
- Removed all Jekyll-specific files and directories from the project, including configuration files, layouts, includes, and Sass files.

## Next.js Project Setup
- Initialized a new Next.js project in the current directory.
- Handled conflicts with existing files by temporarily moving them and then restoring them after project creation.

## Dependency Installation
- Installed the following npm packages:
    - `gray-matter`: For parsing frontmatter from Markdown files.
    - `remark` and `remark-html`: For converting Markdown content to HTML.
    - `date-fns`: For date formatting utilities.
    - `@tailwindcss/typography`: Tailwind CSS plugin for styling prose content.
    - `glob`: For finding files matching patterns in directories.

## Markdown Processing (`lib/posts.js`)
- Created `lib/posts.js` to centralize logic for fetching, parsing, and processing blog post Markdown files.
- Implemented functions to:
    - `getSortedPostsData()`: Retrieve and sort all blog posts by date.
    - `getAllPostIds()`: Get all post IDs for static path generation.
    - `getPostData(id)`: Fetch and process a single post's data.
- Modified these functions to:
    - Recursively read Markdown files from nested directories within `_posts`.
    - Sanitize post IDs by removing special characters and replacing spaces with hyphens to create clean URLs.

## UI Updates
- **`app/page.tsx` (Home Page)**:
    - Modified to fetch and display a list of blog posts using `getSortedPostsData()`.
    - Updated `Link` component usage for Next.js 13.
    - Temporarily removed `Date` component usage to prevent crashes during debugging.
- **`app/posts/[id]/page.tsx` (Dynamic Post Page)**:
    - Created to handle dynamic routing for individual blog posts.
    - Implemented `generateStaticParams()` for static site generation of post pages.
    - Temporarily removed `Date` component usage to prevent crashes during debugging.

## Tailwind CSS Configuration
- Created `tailwind.config.ts` and configured it to include the `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin for styling Markdown content.

## Error Handling and Debugging
- Implemented various debugging steps and temporary fixes for persistent issues related to date parsing and file path resolution:
    - Added conditional rendering for the `Date` component to prevent crashes when `dateString` was `undefined`.
    - Modified `components/date.tsx` to use `new Date()` for parsing and added resilience checks for invalid date values (though currently bypassed).
    - Added extensive `console.log` statements in `lib/posts.js` and `components/date.tsx` for debugging purposes (later removed or commented out).
    - Cleared Next.js cache (`.next` directory) during debugging.

## Current Status
- The core Next.js blog structure is set up.
- Markdown files are being read and processed.
- The application should now run without crashing, displaying raw date strings.
- Further work is needed on date formatting and ensuring robust file path resolution for all post IDs.
